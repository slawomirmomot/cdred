# The Bank of Shire

Greatings dear sir or madam! I'm writing to you with a big request: I would like you to implement a host service for our
Bank of Shire.
We hobbits are simple folk and we don't want anything fancy. We don't charge or pay interest, we just want something
where we can store our money and borrow in time of need - it is all based on trust here you see...
We gave this task to one of our young hobbits, but he went off to kill some dragon (can you imagine that? I bet it is
the Tuk blood in his veins!). He was in hurry, so he didn't leave any documentation, or comments in the code, but he did
leave you a test application (good lad!) - you should figure out everything you need from it.

### Tasks

* The `CustomerTest` application should execute without throwing any exceptions.
* The `CustomerTest` application should print out transaction history for each customer in a human readable form.
* Write an `Inspector` application that will block customer operations during inspection and print out summary of all
  customers operations. Please use the `InspectorInterface`.
  It should work like that:

```
   StartInspection()
   ...
   GetFullSummary()
   Console.ReadKey()
   FinishInspection() 
```
* Migrate the solution to .NET 6.- ok 
* Migrate WCF to GRPC. -ok 
* Use asynchronous calls where it's possible. - ok 
* Setup logging with NLog instead of logging with `Console.WriteLine`.
* Persist bank accounts on disk in SQLite database using Entity Framework Core.
* Feel free to change any other code (including shared interface if you need).
* Create a PowerShell script that builds the solution into self-contained, single-file and trimmed binaries.
* Optional: add unit tests
